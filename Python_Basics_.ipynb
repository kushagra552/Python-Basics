        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        " - Python is a popular programming language because it's easy to learn, efficient, and versatile. It's used in many industries and is free to download.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        " - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. It translates Python code into machine code that the computer can understand.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        " - Keywords are reserved words in Python that have specific meanings and purposes and cannot be used as identifiers (EX-true,false,none if,else etc.)\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        " - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes in the language's syntax. Using a keyword as a variable name will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        " - In Python, mutability refers to the capability of an object to be changed or modified after its creation. In Python, lists are a widely used data structure that allows the storage and manipulation of a collection of items.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        " - The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modifiers.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        " - The == and is operators in Python serve distinct comparison purposes:\n",
        "== (Equality): It checks if the values of two objects are the same. It compares the content or data held by the objects.\n",
        "is (Identity): It verifies if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. It checks if the memory addresses of the objects are identical.\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python\n",
        " - A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        " - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        " - Implicit type casting happens automatically, while explicit type casting requires the programmer to intervene.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        " - in Python, conditionals provide a mechanism to control the flow of execution of a program in many programming languages. In Python, the if -statement will run a section of code if and only if the conditional provided is true.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        " -  it allows you to test multiple conditions sequentially until one is found to be true, then execute the corresponding code block only for that condition.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        " - For loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items. While loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements while a condition is true. For loops are designed for iterating over a sequence of items.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n",
        " - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you need to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is met, where the exact number of iterations is unknown beforehand, such as when prompting a user for valid input until they provide the correct format, as you don't know how many times they might need to try before getting it right; in this case, the loop would continue until the input is valid, regardless of how many attempts it takes.\n",
